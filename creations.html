                    <h4>Sannu's Mod (Balatro)</h4>
                    <p>i made <a href="https://github.com/SannusGitHub/sannusmod">this</a> mod for balatro as a part of a small collaboration between
                        my friends, to brush up on my skills with lua and because i've had a
                        balatro obsession. the mod features around 15 jokers with relatively vanilla-like
                        mechanics and art, and two card deck skins
                    </p>
                    <h4>sannu42town (ROBLOX)</h4>
                    <p>done as a small project and now left on the official "i'll work on this later" shelf for now
                        <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/11086268242/sannu42town-2">this</a> project was a small collab with a few friends trying to revive an injoke
                        and make it an actual small thing.

                        while unfinished, i still intend to return to it in some capacity by adding more or reworking it

                    <p>i (used to) work and draft for the <a href="#">COVGC</a> hoax account,
                        namely submitting a <a href="https://x.com/CutVideoGame/status/1675868086077911040">post</a> about an unused Doom FOOT weapon
                        and collaborating with, drafting and creating several other posts uploaded and displayed on the twitter account

                    <h4>Liminal Dominos (VRChat)</h4>
                    <p>as a part of a week long attempt to familiarize myself with world design, texturing, modelling from scratch,
                        a bit of UdonSharp I decided to create a <a href="https://vrchat.com/home/launch?worldId=wrld_1949d7a3-80e4-4540-8d37-2dc9fe874853">Liminal Dominos</a> map for a friend
                        based off of a reference image

                    <h4>Image Archive (VRChat)</h4>
                    <p>as a small fun activity i like to go around world-hopping and interacting in vrchat, collecting a surplus of images in regards to
                        my adventures on the platform. archive download available <s><a href="#">here</a></s>
